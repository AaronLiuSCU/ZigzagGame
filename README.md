# ZigzagGame
Zigzag is a game concept I created as I learned unity. The goal of the game is to survive the onslaught of obstacles in your way as you zigzag and fight through them.
Run the executable to play the game. 
Spacebar to change direction. 
Hold left mouse to charge up your gun defense mechanism, release to shoot. The longer you hold it, the more bullets it will shoot, and the more obstacles you'll avoid. 
Successfully charging your gun defense mechanism for in between 2.4-2.7 seconds will unleash a supercharged bullet that obliterates anything in its way. 
Charging up your gun defense mechanism will consume energy, and not doing so passively recharges it. When you have no more energy you will not be able to charge up your gun.
Golden obstacles, when destroyed, will destroy more blocks around it. It is possible to chain obstacle destructions to clear the most space for your character to venture forward.
Have fun!
